Project Name: Beginner's Electronic Kit- A cost effective alternative to NI Elvis.

Team : Aaquila Arul Arzela (EDM12B001)
       Allu Asha Kumari (EDM12B003)
       Ambatti Pravallika (EDM12B004)

Idea : Beginner's Electronic kit is a cost effective alternative to NI Elvis implemented using 
       TM4C launchpad kit/ in arduino uno board. It has an oscilloscope, function generator(sine, 
       square, triangle, DC with amplitude, frequency variation), ultrasonic sensor, temperature 
       humidity sensor, ldr-led circuit, hex display, relay-led-switch circuit, piezzo-buzzer circuit, 
       connectors, resistors, capacitors, power supply and bread board. We have used processing IDE as 
       the graphical interface.

Components used: Arduino uno board
