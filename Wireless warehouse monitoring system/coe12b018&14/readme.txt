Project title: Wireless warehouse monitoring system

Team: Nitin Vivek Bharti (COE12B018)
      Medha Vasishth (COE12B014)

Idea: As the size of warehouse are increasing year by year the problem of 
maintaining it also increases, as it becomes difficult to keep track of each of 
the equipment is working properly and along with it the use of traditional way 
of transmission through cables is getting costlier. So, a small compact 
wireless system is designed using temperature sensor LM35, humidity sensor 
DHT11 and a LDR for measuring the light. This system receives the data and 
send to app through Bluetooth where all values can be observed on screen. 
A Nokia 5110 display is added to the system so that the maintenance person 
can see the values at the system itself. It is compact, small and portable so 
that can be kept anywhere to monitor the condition of the area. This helps 
in checking each and every area of the warehouse at the same time without 
travelling to all the places in warehouse.

Components Used: Tiva TM4C123GHPM, LM35, DHT11, LDR, HC-05,Nokia 5110 LCD, 
Buzzer.
