This Projet is Analysis of air quality using MQ135 gas sensor.

To run this install Keil and use TM4C microcontroller.

Interface TM4C with Nokia LCd display and gas sensor. These connections are provided in the dataseheets present in docs folder.

To run the code goto folder named air quality and run Nokia5110.uvproj file in keil.

This will compute concentration of gases like cO2 and NH3 at different times and values are displayed in nokia LCD Display. 

Videos for the same are present in videos folder
